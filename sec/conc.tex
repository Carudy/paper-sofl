We proposed a novel, efficient and privacy-preserving federated learning framework named Self-organizing Federated Learning (SOFL). SOFL adopted MPC-based secret sharing methods to solve the secure aggregation problem and achieve high security. It also employ consensus algorithms-based leader election algorithms to provides high efficiency and robustness. SOFL is lightweight and easy-deploying for many existing federated frameworks.

However, it still remains a problem for federated learning, that malicious attackers are more harmful and difficult to defend against compared to honest-but-curious attackers. Some blockchain methods are inspiring to solve the malicious attacks such as poisoning and adversarial examples, which can be adopted to enhance SOFL to provide higher security. Federated learning is potential and will make a better life for humans.
